					<h1>Introduction to ExoMars 2018</h1>
					<p>The 2018 mission of the ExoMars programme will deliver a European rover and a Russian surface platform to the surface of Mars. A Proton rocket will be used to launch the mission, which will arrive to Mars after a nine-month journey. The ExoMars rover will travel across the Martian surface to search for signs of life. It will collect samples with a drill and analyse them with next-generation instruments. ExoMars will be the first mission to combine the capability to move across the surface and to study Mars at depth.</p>
					<p>After landing, the rover will egress from the platform to start its science mission. The primary objective is to land the rover at a site with high potential for finding well-preserved organic material, particularly from the very early history of the planet. The rover will establish the physical and chemical properties of Martian samples, mainly from the subsurface.</p>
					<p>The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, part of the 2016 ExoMars mission, will support communications. The Rover Operations Control Centre (ROCC) will be located in Turin, Italy. The ROCC will monitor and control the ExoMars rover operations. Commands to the Rover will be transmitted through the Orbiter and the ESA space communications network operated at ESA's European Space Operations Centre (ESOC).</p>

					<h1>MOLA</h1>
					<p>The Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA), is an instrument on the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS), a spacecraft that was launched on November 7, 1996. MGS carried a laser altimeter on board to determinate the height of surface on Mars</p>
					<p>MOLA collected altimetry data until June 30,2001. Then it operated as a radiometer until October 7, 2006. Right now, you are looking at the map generated from MOLA data</p>

					<h1>Landing Site Selection Working Group</h1>
					<p>During October 2013, the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Space Reasearch Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IKI) [on behalf of the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos)], agreed to appoint a Landing Site Selection Working Group (LSSWG) to make recommendation to the agencies regarding landing sites for the ExoMars 2018 mission.</p>
					<p>At first, eight landing sites were proposed:</p>
					<ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left: 70px">
						<li>Mawrth Vallis 1</li>
						<li>Mawrth Vallis 2</li>
						<li>Oxia Planum 1</li>
						<li>Oxia Planum 2</li>
						<li>Coogoon Valles</li>
						<li>Hypanis Vallis</li>
						<li>Simud Vallis</li>
						<li>Aram Dorsum</li>
						<li>Southern Isidis</li>
					</ul>
					</br>
					<p>Put the mouse on the points and click them to see which landing site you are looking !</p>

					<h1>Mars Landing Sites</h1>
					<p>Considering the mission's search-for-life objectives, the LSSWG has identified four landing sites that possess a clear, higher scientific interest:</p>
					<ul style="list-style-type:disc;margin-left: 70px">
						<li>Aram Dorsum</li>
						<li>Hypanis Vallis</li>
						<li>Oxia Planum 1</li>
						<li>Mawrth Vallis</li>
					</ul>
					</br>
					<p>These sites are within the latitude constraint. The ExoMars rover is designed to operate in the latitude range between 5° South to 25° North </p>

					<h1>Aram Dorsum</h1>
					<h3>Why Aram Dorsum?</h3>
					<p>Aram Dorsum is located on plains of middle Noachian age, about 4 billion years old, in a region that has been sculpted during two major aqueous periods. It comprises layered sedimentary rocks crossed by a prominent inverted channel ridge, which is 80 km long and 1.2 km wide.</p>
					<p>The Aram Dorsum inverted channel is part of an ancient alluvial landscape. The overlying materials that are present in the rest of the site appear to be a mixture of sedimentary deposits and suggest that the inverted channel system has been exhumed only relatively recently ( some parts of the terrain may have been exposed for as little as 100 milion years).</p>
					<p>The ancient lakes and rivers at this site would have been favourable for the development of life, as well as for the preservation of its biosignatures. The long-lived aqueous conditions recorded in the migrating channel pattern would have been critical for establishing a habitable environment at the Aram Dorsum site</p>

					<h3>The High Resolution Stereo Camera</h3>
					<p>Before continue with the explanation, you should know that the MOLA is not the only data that we have to see and analyze Mars. We are glad to present you the High Resolution Stereo Camera</p>
					<p>The High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) is a camera experiment on Mars Express.At an altitude of 250 km from Mars, HRSC can produce images with a resolution of 2.3 meters/pixel of 2.35 kilometers square Mars Terrain.</p>

					<h1>Aram Dorsum</h1>
					<h3>Landing site in Aram Dorsum</h3>
					<p>The total relief is minimal, with a variation of less than 70 m. The stratigraphy within the landing ellipse includes thick remnant mesas, about 100 m high. The majority of the landing ellipse is covered by polygonally fractured terrain extending from either side of the inverted channel. This is thought to consist of marginal flood plain deposits, or alluvial sediments.<p>
					<p>The available data do not show clear evidence of hydrated minerals, although they may be hidden by overlying dust. Some multispectral data suggest sporadic occurrences of phyllosilicates (chemically altered clay minerals) within the landing ellipse.</p>
					<p>For a 2019 landing, the predicted winds above 3 km altitude are very weak, although models predict strong winds at altitudes below 2 km because Aram Dorsum lies within a “trade winds” corridor.</p>

					<h1>Hypanis Vallis</h1>
					<h3>Why Hypanis Vallis?</h3>
					<p>Hypanis Vallis is one of several valleys situated between two large outflow channels, Maja Vallis in the west and Shalbatana Vallis in the east.</p>
					<p>The valleys are thought to have been formed by groundwater seepage or surface runoff. Several of the valleys, including Hypanis Vallis, have fan-shaped deposits at their termini. These fluvial deposits are interpreted as the remnants of a delta that formed in a lake. They are characterised by distinct layering at their margins, providing access to the various sedimentary layers.</p>

					<h1>Oxia Planum</h1>
					<h3>Why Oxia Planum?</h3>
					<p>The region is characterised by ancient highland cratered terrains that become increasingly eroded towards the highland-lowland boundary.</p>
					<p>The candidate landing site area in Oxia Planum is located inside a shallow basin, at the outlet of the Coogoon Valles system. The region was chosen to include extensive, layered exposures rich in iron and magnesium phyllosilicates.</p>
					<p>The main scientific concern for this site relates to the lack of precise information regarding the geologic context and origin of the clay-bearing unit. However, the phyllosilicate deposits are seen as the key to the study of aqueous activity on early Mars and the search for evidence of habitable environments early in the planet’s history.</p>

					<h3>HiRISE</h3>
					<p>Before continue with the explanation, you should know that MOLA data and HRSC are not the only data that we have to see and analyze Mars. We introduce you now the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment.</p>
					<p>The High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) is a camera on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) and have a resolution of 0.3 m from an altitude of 300 km. One of the main goals of the MRO is to map the Martian landscape with it's high-resolution cameras in order to choose landing sites. </p>

					<h1>Mawrth Vallis</h1>
					<h3>Why Mawrth Vallis?</h3>
					<p>This area contains a large outflow channel known as Mawrth Vallis, which once discharged huge amounts of water onto the northern plains. The proposed ExoMars landing site is situated just south of this channel.</p>
					<p>The region surrounding Mawrth Vallis contains one of the largest exposures of phyllosilicates (clay minerals produced by chemical weathering) detected on Mars. These deposits provide a unique opportunity to evaluate aqueous activity on early Mars and point to the possibility that habitable environments may have existed during the Noachian period (from the formation of the planet to perhaps 3.6 billion years ago). Other deposits and outcrops in the region show the highest degree of mineral alteration identified so far on Mars.</p>
